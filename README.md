# Recon Remote Injector/Purge
===============

Using [recon](https://github.com/ferd/recon) usually infers having it on the runtime node.
This might not always be the case in existing projects, where recon is not being included.
With the useful utility you can remotely load/purge recon from a erlang node ( at your own risk! )
